# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet twice a week (once on Saturday and once on Thursday), in the evening at around 6:00 PM. Each meeting will last 1 to 1.5 hours. We will use Zoom to host the meetings if everyone is not available to meet in person. However, on Saturdays, we will make an attempt to meet in person. Each week the designated note taker changes, but they will write notes on a shared document in a shared folder on Google Drive.
2. **Assistance** 
If someone needs my help or opinion on a task they will be able to contact me via instant message - everyone should be expected to respond within 4 hours. We have a mutual message group too.
3. **Respect** 
To ensure that every team member has an opportunity to speak, at the start, middle, and end of the meeting we will go in a circle and share ideas one by one. We will make sure everyone is respectful and participating by including people who are not talking much in the conversation. We will hear out everyoneâ€™s ideas to ensure no voices get drowned, and if a member does not respect others we will talk to them about it.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Everyone will contribute to the development of the code in some form according to the desires of the team. However, 2 members will research one algorithm and its implementation and the other two will research the other. We will come together to discuss integration. Some tasks might be shared, such as parsing the data. We will address complications or unforeseen work by trying to predict workloads and reaching out to our mentor if complications arise. There may be instances where we might have to work longer than expected each week to address unforeseen problems.
5. **Time Commitment** 
4 hours per week is expected of each group member. There are prior time commitments - some members have research, heavy classes, and RSOs. When conflicts inevitably occur we will make changes to prevent them again (example: adjust meeting times a little bit or do some more load balancing).
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
To dissolve disagreements we will talk as a team and might resort to voting. If a team member has not accomplished their task we will try to help them, and if the problem persists we will talk to a mentor. If one or more members is habitually late by accident we will adjust meeting times. If one team member is struggling we will try to explain relevant ideas to them and if it fails, we will have another team member work more closely with them.
